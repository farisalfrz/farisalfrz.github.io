                    <h2>Stephen Curry</h2>
                    <p><b>Wardell Stephen Curry II</b> (born March 14, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
                         Widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, and as the greatest shooter in NBA history, 
                         Curry is credited with revolutionizing the sport by inspiring teams and players to take more three-point shots. 
                         An eight-time NBA All-Star and eight-time All-NBA selection, including four times on the first team, he has been named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) twice, 
                         has won four NBA championships, and received an NBA Finals MVP Award and an NBA All-Star Game MVP Award.</p>
                         <p>In 2014-15, Curry won his first league MVP award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975. The following season, 
                            he became the first player to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and lead the league in scoring while shooting above 50-40-90. 
                            That same year, the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in an NBA season en route to reaching the 2016 NBA Finals, 
                            which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games. Curry helped the Warriors return to the NBA Finals in 2017, 2018, and 2019, 
                            winning back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018, but falling to the Toronto Raptors in 2019. After missing the playoffs in 2020 and 2021, 
                            Curry won a fourth championship with the Warriors against the Boston Celtics in 2022, and was named Finals MVP.</p>
